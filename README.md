The above is actually my now current config cause i already lost the original . Some are Borrowed and Some were found in logs after.
if the BoardID is wrong , the router Wont bootup . there are some options we may look after.
OperatorID is responsible for Changing configs . I've found that ```RILT``` will Turn on the WEB as well as will be on English. We can also choose ```CMCC``` which is in Chinese .

we can set it by
```ritool set OperatorID RILT```

IT is best to keep a backup of this dump.
