The above is actually my now current config cause i already lost the original . Some are Borrowed and Some were found in logs after.
if the BoardID is wrong , the router Wont bootup . there are some options we may look after.
OperatorID is responsible for Changing configs . I've found that ```RILT``` will Turn on the WEB as well as will be on English. We can also choose ```CMCC``` which is in Chinese .

we can set it by
```ritool set OperatorID RILT```


It is best to keep a backup of this dump.
 
 ```go```to Continue the boot process

Now the web is active . if it isn't you may need to restart a few times or even reset by using command ```reset```

## Shell Authentication
If the Web is not Active We can get inside from shell to get access to the router
After pressing ```go```or just router to boot . After 5-7 minutes We get access to ABS User CLI which is pretty bad 
```
  enable    Turn on privileged mode command
  help      Description of the interactive help system
  hw_nat    platform special network commands,eg. hg_nat -g
  ifconfig  ifconfig is used to configure, or view the configuration of, a network interface.
  ip        show / manipulate routing, devices, policy routing and tunnels
  list      Print command list
  nslookup  The nslookup command is used to query Internet name servers interactively for information
  ping      Send echo messages
  ps        Scan a host, print all open ports
  route     show / manipulate the IP routing table
  show      system display
  top       Provide a view of process activity in real time
```


use ```enable``` now ```help```


```
  configure  Configuration from vty interface
  disable    Turn off privileged mode command
  exit       Exit current mode and down to previous mode
  help       Description of the interactive help system

  shell      start shell, need to input the user and password
  show       Show information from vty interface
  terminal   Set terminal line parameters
```

## WEB AUTHENTICATION

It should be at 192.168.1.1 when in RILT and 192.168.254.254 in other operatorID

```
Username : classicadmin
Password : Cr3d3nti@lofNok!aONT0061_P@SSW)RD
```
The username and password for Non-Classictech routers seems to be

```
Username : CMCCAdmin
Password : aDm8H%MdA
```

there is user level username and password but is very limited .
```
username : admin
password : admin
```

## Telnet

login as classicadmin then visit the site ```<yourrouterip>/system.cgi?telnet``` and toggle the switch
Telnet will be available at port ```2333```

Logging into telnet . 
```
Username : user
Password : 00000000
```
